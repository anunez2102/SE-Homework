   <p> I am a Bronx native that supports Bronx cooperative businesses and was in an incubator program to have my own co-operative business.</p>
</div>
<div>
     <p> I am a lover of street art and appreciate its different mediums such as graffiti, clothing, and music.</p>
 </div>
 <div>
     <p> With two littles, I don't watch too much of my own programs but when time permits I watch A Million Little Things, Masked Singer, and DopeSick. Catch a peek at some Masked Singer reveals. <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/felKiVVPgF0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
